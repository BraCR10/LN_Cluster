## üß† Overview

**LN_Cluster** is an experimental project created solely for personal learning purposes. It serves as a hands-on exploration of the Lightning Network, aiming to deepen understanding of its architecture and operation through practical experimentation.

> **Note:** This project is **not intended for production use**. It is a personal endeavor to gain insights into the Lightning Network's inner workings.

## üîç Purpose

The primary goals of LN_Cluster are:

- **Personal Education:** To gain  understanding of the Lightning Network by building and experimenting with a simulated cluster.
- **Hands-on Learning:** To explore the setup and management of Lightning Network nodes and channels in a controlled environment.
- **Technical Exploration:** To familiarize oneself with tools and technologies related to the Lightning Network, such as Docker and LND.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Simulated Lightning Network Cluster:** Creation of multiple LND nodes interconnected to form a simulated Lightning Network.
- **Channel Management:** Establishment and closure of payment channels between nodes to simulate real-world transactions.
- **Isolated Environment:** Utilization of Docker to create an isolated environment for safe experimentation.

## üìö Inspiration

This project is inspired by the [LND Docker README](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docker/README.md#create-lightning-network-cluster), which provides guidance on setting up a Lightning Network cluster using Docker. LN_Cluster adapts these principles for personal experimentation and learning.
